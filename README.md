# Classification-NLP-Project---GDSC-Final-Project
Our project detects fake news using NLP. We studied datasets of real and fake news, collected data from various sources, and cleaned it by removing irrelevant info, handling missing data, and tokenizing text. EDA included word frequency and sentiment analysis. We engineered features like TF-IDF scores and developed a voting classifier model.
